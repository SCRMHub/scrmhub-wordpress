<h1>Sharing Help</h1>

<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Sharing Position</h3>
<p>The plugin provides a couple of options for installing the sharing buttons on your site:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Automatically</strong><br>
		This is where we will automatically append the buttons into the post output.
		<ul>
			<li><u>Top</u> : Above the post content</li>
			<li><u>Bottom</u> : Below the post content</li>
			<li><u>Both</u> : Above and Below of the post content</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Manual</strong><br>
		You want to add our code manually to your templates. This provides a much greater level of control and some additional options such as rendering only one button, all buttons, adding settings, etc.
	</li>	
</ul>

<h3>Sharing post types</h3>
<p>Choose the types of Wordpress post type the buttons will appear on. By default we pre-tick 'Post' and 'Page', but any custom types will appear. However we cannot guarantee how our buttons will render on those pages as it is depen     dant on </p>

<h3>Show icon only</h3>
<p>By default this is set to 'No', which means it will display a Button with the network's icon and name. Set it to 'Yes' and it will show a simple square icon with the network's logo in it.</p>

<h2>Networks</h2>
<p>You can enable each network you wish to use here. The noteable difference is the Twitter setting that allows you to specify:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Via</strong><br>
		Any shares will have 'via @[value]' appended to the share text.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Use Quotes</strong><br>
		This will wrap the text of the tweets in quote marks to make it clear it is the title of an article. This is optional, but something we like doing.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Code Use</h2>
<p>Now the good bit... How to use the code in your template. They all render in PHP using Wordpress Hooks but can also be called using RAW PHP.</p>

<h3>Render all share buttons</h3>
<p>This is the same code the automatic options call, and will render everything as you've defined it in these options.</p>
<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
	do_action( 'scrmhub_share' );
?&gt;</code></pre>
<br>

<h3>Render a single share button</h3>
<p>If you wish to render a single button, and (optionally) give it a custom label, use the below example.</p>
<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
	do_action('scrmhub_share_button', array(
		'network' => 'twitter',
		'label' => 'Share to Twitter'
	));
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p><em>Note: That if you want to render a Twitter button as per this example, but have Twitter disabled on the option page, nothing will render as the system thinks the button is disabled.</em></p>
<br>

<h3>Output the URL for sharing to a network</h3>
<p>If you want to just output the URL for sharing into your own code for a custom pop-up script for example, this will output it</p>
<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
	do_action( 'scrmhub_share_url', 'twitter');
?&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, if you wish to get the url into your PHP code, you can call it using our global helper function.</p>
<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
	global $scrmhub_share_url;
    $url = $scrmhub_share_url('facebook');
?&gt;</code></pre>
