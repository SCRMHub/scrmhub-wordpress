<h1>Activity Help</h1>

<p>SCRM Hub has a built in activity tracking system that can track user events, page views, etc. This data can then be viewed with the SCRM Hub dashboards. It includes information like sources, pages, gender, etc. The more we know about your user's behaviour the more our upcoming MRT technology will be able to help you.</p>
